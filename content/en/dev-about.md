### Hi! Salut! Ciao!

## I'm Gilles Hoarau

I like to wake up early, learn every day, and think about what make life beautiful ☀️

### Over the past 15 years, I've worked on a wide range of development and graphic design projects,
covering the entire process from creative brainstorming, to final delivery

My adventure started by writing a book to teach photo manipulation. It sales around 20000 copies.
Few years later, I used my self-taught skills in a 360° communication agency,
producing creative media and effective tools to bring satisfaction to all of our customers.

In 2014, I joined the Digital Factory of Groupe PSA,
to facilitate tech scouting committees and develop proof of concepts on new trends:
Internet-Of-Things, Real-time 3D, Progressive Web Apps, Chatbots & Vocal Assistants.
My teammates call me as a “Jack of all trades” and “Innovation guy”.

From 2021 to 2023, I led the development of 2 projects, in the new company Stellantis:
a Search Engine powered by AI and an Order Tracking module connected to the supply chain events.

Overall, I appreciated working with teams from around the world, exposing me to a wealth of different cultures.
I am very grateful for the inspiring leadership that pushed me so far.

Starting in 2024, I've decided to level up my development skills,
particularly in the area of web apps that leverage generative AI capabilities.

While listening to great opportunities, I'm available for freelance work 🚀

### I got 4 cats 🥰 and 4 chickens.

When they spare me some times, I try to win at chess, play piano and learn Italian for my next holidays.
