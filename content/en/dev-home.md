# Hi, I'm Gilles ≈ a developer

## I'm a self-taught web developer and designer with a constant thirst for new technologies and design trends.

### My developer toolkit

Throughout my career, I've tackled every stage of web development and deployment,
from brewing the coffee ☕️ to scaling cloud infrastructure, writing tons of code, testing it thoroughly,
building containers in CI/CD pipelines, and celebrating successful launches.

Front-end: NX, Angular, NestJS, Firebase
Back-end: Symfony, Docker, MongoDB, Redis
Bonus skill: ThreeJS

### Creative media design

My creative journey began with traditional drawing and sketching.
Soon, I was exploring the world of computer graphics, playing with photo editing and 3D modeling.
Later, I honed my skills in print design and branding before diving headfirst into web design.
Back then, smartphones hadn't even conquered the world yet.

My design toolbox: Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma

Bonus tool: Blender and generative AI for image creation!
