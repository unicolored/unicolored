# Gilles Hoarau
## ‚âà fullStack developer ‚âà graphic designer

Hi! Salut! Ciao! I'm Gilles Hoarau, an experienced web developer and graphic designer with a passion for learning and innovation. Over the past 15 years, I've worked on a diverse array of projects, covering everything from creative brainstorming to final delivery.

My career began with writing a book on photo manipulation, which sold around 20,000 copies.

A few years later, I joined a full-service advertising agency, producing creative media that brought satisfaction to our clients.

In 2014, I joined Groupe PSA's Digital Factory, facilitating tech scouting committees and developing proof of concepts on emerging trends, including Internet-Of-Things, Real-time 3D, Progressive Web Apps, Chatbots & Vocal Assistants.

My colleagues often referred to me as a ‚ÄúJack of all trades‚Äù for my versatile skillset.

From 2021 to 2023, I led the development of two projects at Stellantis, including an AI-driven search engine for vehicles and an Order Tracking module connected with the supply chain management system.

Working with international teams not only exposed me to different cultures and perspectives, but also inspired me to grow both personally and professionally. I am deeply grateful for this experience.

Starting in 2024, I'm now focusing my web development efforts on creating innovative web apps that leverage the latest advancements in generative AI.

While I'm open to listening to exciting opportunities, I'm currently available for freelance web development projects. üöÄ
