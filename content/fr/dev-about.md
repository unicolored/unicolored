### Hi! Salut! Ciao!

## I'm Gilles Hoarau

I like to wake up early, learn every day, and think about what makes life beautiful ‚òÄÔ∏è

### In the past 15 years, I've worked on a diverse array of development and graphic design projects,
covering everything from creative brainstorming to final delivery.

My adventure began with writing a book to teach photo manipulation.
The book, titled <u>Scan et retouche d'images</u>, sold around 20,000 copies.
A few years later, I joined a full-service advertising agency, where I used my self-taught skills
to produce creative media that brought satisfaction to all of our customers.

In 2014, I joined Groupe PSA‚Äôs Digital Factory to facilitate tech scouting committees
and develop proof of concepts on new trends:
Internet-Of-Things, Real-time 3D, Progressive Web Apps, Chatbots & Vocal Assistants.
My colleagues often refer to me as a ‚ÄúJack of all trades‚Äù.

From 2021 to 2023, I led the development of 2 projects for Stellantis:
an AI-driven vehicle Search Engine and an Order Tracking module connected with the supply chain management system.

Overall, I appreciated working with teams from around the world, 
exposing me to a wealth of different cultures and perspectives.
The inspiring leadership I experienced pushed me to grow and develop in ways I never imagined.
I am deeply grateful for these experiences.

Starting in 2024, I'm now focusing my development efforts
specifically on web apps that leverage cutting-edge generative AI technologies.

While I'm open to listening to exciting opportunities,
I'm currently available for freelance web development projects. üöÄ

Drop me a line if you have any questions or ideas. ‚û°Ô∏è [Contact](/contact)

### I got 4 cats ü•∞ and 4 chickens.

When they spare me some time, I try to win at chess, play piano and learn Italian for my next holidays.
