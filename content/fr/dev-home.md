# 👋 Gilles ≈ développeur

## Un autodidacte curieux, passionné par les applications web, le design créatif et les nouvelles technologies.

### My developer stack

In my journey from brewing coffee ☕️ to celebrating successful launches 🎉,
I've covered every aspect of web development and deployment.
This includes setting up scalable cloud infrastructure,
coding a lot, testing, and building containers on CI/CD pipelines.

My favorite stacks ⭐️:
[NX, Angular, NestJS, Firebase];
[Symfony, Docker, MongoDB, Redis];

Special mention for: ThreeJS

### Creative media design

My creative design journey started with traditional pencil drawings and sketches.
I made the jump to computer graphics, playing with photos and 3D models.
Then I focused for a while on Print design and branding before mastering web design.
It was back in the days before smartphones took over the world 😅.

My favorite tools: Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma.

Special mention for: Blender and new generative AI for image creation!
